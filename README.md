# Study_BU
Study_BU is an application for helping Boston University students find their place to study at BU. This app was created for our EC327 "Intro to Software Engineering" group project which taught C/C++. Our team name is "Hope we get higher than a C++." 

We used Android Studio, Java, and Google Map APIs.
