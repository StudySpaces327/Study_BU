# Study_BU
Study_BU is an application to help Boston University students find their place to study at BU. This app was created for our EC327 "Intro to Software Engineering" group project which taught C/C++ by Professor Douglas Densmore. Our team name is "Hope we get higher than a C++." 

Our app uses Google Maps API on Android Studio to create markers, and user's current location. We also used Vectr, a graphic design software, to create the background of the user interface.
